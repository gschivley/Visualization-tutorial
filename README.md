# Visualization tutorial
This Data Visualization tutorial was created as a class assignment for CMU's [Practical Data Science](datasciencecourse.org) class. It uses Michael Waskom's fantastic [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/) statistical visualization library. The tutorial takes the form of a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) .ipynb notebook. You can view the notebook here on GitHub, or view it [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gschivley/Visualization-tutorial/blob/master/Visualization%20tutorial.ipynb) with nbviewer. I also recommend that you download the notebook yourself and try modifying some of the parameters to see how they can affect each of the visualization examples.

## Data
The examples used in this tutorial come from the U.S. Energy Information Agency's [Residential Energy Consumption Survey](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009) (RECS). I have used unweighted individual household [microdata](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.php?view=microdata). Since the data have not been properly weighted, take care with making any conclusions from the figures.
